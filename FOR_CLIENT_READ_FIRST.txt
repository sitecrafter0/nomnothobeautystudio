## Timeline

```
TODAY:          You choose gateway(s)

## Free Test Cards (No Money Charged)

While testing, you can use these fake cards:

**For Yoco:**
- Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Expiry Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- CVC: Any 3 numbers (e.g., 123)

**Result:** ✅ Processes successfully BUT charges $0.00
